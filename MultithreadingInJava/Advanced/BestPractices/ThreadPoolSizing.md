# Thread Pool Sizing

Proper thread pool sizing is essential for achieving optimal performance and resource utilization in concurrent Java applications. Too few threads can underutilize resources and lead to poor throughput, while too many threads can cause excessive context switching, increased memory usage, or even application crashes.

## Why Thread Pool Sizing Matters

- **Efficiency:** The right number of threads maximizes CPU and system throughput.
- **Resource Management:** Prevents overwhelming the system with too many threads.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensures tasks are processed in a timely manner.

## Key Factors Affecting Thread Pool Size

1. **Type of Tasks**
    - **CPU-bound tasks:** Require more computation (e.g., data processing, calculations).
    - **I/O-bound tasks:** Spend significant time waiting on I/O (e.g., network, file system).

2. **Available System Resources**
    - Number of CPU cores.
    - Available memory.

3. **Task Behavior**
    - Blocking vs. non-blocking operations.
    - Task duration and frequency.

## Sizing Formulas

### For CPU-bound Tasks

The optimal pool size is generally:

```
Number of threads = Number of CPU cores + 1
```

- Rationale: While one thread is waiting (for example, on a cache miss), another can utilize the CPU.

Java Example:
```java
int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(coreCount + 1);
```

### For I/O-bound Tasks

The optimal pool size is higher, since threads spend more time waiting:

```
Number of threads = Number of CPU cores * (1 + (Wait time / Compute time))
```

- Estimate Wait/Compute ratio based on profiling or logging.

Java Example:
```java
int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
int waitToComputeRatio = 10; // Example value—adjust as needed
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(coreCount * (1 + waitToComputeRatio));
```

## Best Practices

- **Profile Your Application:** Use monitoring tools to measure actual wait and compute times.
- **Start Small, Scale Gradually:** Begin with a conservative pool size and increase based on observed performance.
- **Set Maximum Pool Size:** Prevent unbounded thread creation by setting a reasonable upper limit.
- **Use Bounded Queues:** Combine with a bounded task queue to avoid resource exhaustion.
- **Monitor and Tune:** Continuously monitor CPU, memory, and thread pool metrics in production.

## Tools & Utilities

- Java’s `ThreadPoolExecutor` allows fine-grained control over pool sizing, queue types, and rejection policies.
- Monitoring tools (JVisualVM, JConsole, etc.) help analyze thread activity and resource usage.

## Example: Custom ThreadPoolExecutor

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
int maxPoolSize = coreCount * 2;
long keepAliveTime = 60L;
BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100);

ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    coreCount,
    maxPoolSize,
    keepAliveTime,
    TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    workQueue,
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy()
);
```
